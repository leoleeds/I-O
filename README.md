# I-O
Result from the I/O practical for GEOG5003M: Programming for Geographical Information Analysis.

Please open the Model.py file and run in suitable environment (e.g. Spyder). Output should include: 1. A scatter plot of environment and agents; 2. An example original and moved coordinates to verify that the code has functioned correctly; 3. The time taken to execute the code in seconds.

The Environment should export to a .csv when the model is executed.

The model at various stages of development following previous practicals is available in the following GitHub repositories: 
1. Agents! - https://github.com/leoleeds/Agents
3. Communicating - https://github.com/leoleeds/Communicating
4. Animation/Behaviour - https://github.com/leoleeds/Animation-Behaviour
